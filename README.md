# EISSample

*Ensemble inversion slice sampling* (EISS) is a robust, self-tuning MCMC method for posterior inference. The wider project is still work in progress; we make available here a simplified working version, `eissample_lite` that implements parallel slice sampling.

This algorithm was used for [this paper](https://github.com/lacerbi/visvest-causinf). Refer to that for a more detailed description.
In the meanwhile, please contact me at <luigi.acerbi@unige.ch> for more information.
